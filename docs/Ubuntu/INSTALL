security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.

created. The core of EasySCP are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. EasySCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

4) Installation
---------------

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /usr/src
	# tar xjvf easyscp-1.2.0.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./easyscp-1.2.0

3. Install the required packages

   First update your system:
        # sudo apt-get install aptitude
	# sudo aptitude update && aptitude upgrade

   Install all required packages:
   Make sure you have added multiverse into your /etc/apt/sources.list

	# sudo aptitude install lsb-release
	# sudo aptitude install $(cat ./docs/Ubuntu/ubuntu-packages-`lsb_release -cs`)

	(if you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(if you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site'. 'mail name' should
        be the server's domain. If you've set debian up correctly on install your
        domain should be already shown. Select 'no' to force sync updates.)
	(if you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')
	(if you get to the rootkithunter screen, select two time 'yes')

4. (optional) Check the easyscp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

5. Build the Software by using make:
	# sudo make -f Makefile.ubuntu install

6. Copy all the directories into your system. If you have not yet, now is a good
   time to make backups of your server. The following steps do fundamental
   changes to your system configuration.
	# sudo cp -R /tmp/easyscp/* /

7. Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root
	login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege tables.
	# mysql_secure_installation

8. Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory and
	start the engine setup:
	# cd /var/www/easyscp/engine/setup
	# sudo perl easyscp-setup

9. Install EasySCP step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://www.easyscp.net to solve the problem.

10. Clean the temporary folders:
	# sudo rm -fR /tmp/easyscp
